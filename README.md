The Java code simulates drone navigation using BFS algorithm. Here's an explanation of the code:
The Drone class defines a drone with its starting and ending coordinates, start time, and a list of its path coordinates.
The move method of the Drone class takes in a row and column coordinate and adds it to the path list.
The main method reads input from the user to create a list of drones, puts them in a timeline map based on their start time, and initializes a grid of -1 values.
The bfs method takes in a drone and the grid and performs a breadth-first search to find a path from the drone's starting coordinates to its ending coordinates. It uses a queue to store coordinates to visit, a map to store previous coordinates, and the constructPath method to construct the drone's path.
The DIRS array stores the possible directions the drone can move in.
The constructPath method takes in the prev map, the drone, and the final row and column coordinates, and constructs the drone's path using a stack to backtrack from the final coordinates to the starting coordinates.
Finally, the main method iterates through the drones in the timeline and performs BFS on each drone to get its path, which is printed to the console.
Overall, the code uses BFS to find the shortest path for each drone and construct their paths using a stack.
